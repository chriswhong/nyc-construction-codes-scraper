# nyc-construction-codes-scraper
node.js scraper for NYC construction codes in PDF format

This scraper reads in PDFs [published by the DOB](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/codes_and_reference_materials/2014_cons_codes_table_of_contents.shtml)

The plan is to make the NYC construction codes exist online in an easy to use, searchable UI just like [chicagocode.org](http://chicagocode.org)

This scraper sets up the following folder structure:

-Chapter 
--Article
---Section
